# Presentation Layer for Custom URL Shortener

![alt-text](https://imgur.com/V8s3aZv.png)

I built [a URL shortener API](https://github.com/jaebradley/jaeurls) and this is the frontend to create one of these custom "shortened" URLs.

I also did this so I could build a React project using `Webpack` (and `Webpack Dev Server`) from scratch (instead of using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)).
